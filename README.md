# A Conditional Normalizing Flow for Accelerated Multi-Coil MR Imaging

## Description
This is the official implementation of the paper "A Conditional Normalizing Flow for Accelerated Multi-Coil MR Imaging" (ICML 2023).
This repository contains the code for training and testing a conditional normalizing flow for multicoil MRI reconstruction.

## Installation
Please follow the instructions to setup the environment to run the repo.
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a new environment with the following commands
```
conda create -n mri_cnf python=3.9 numpy=1.23 pip
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda install -c conda-forge cupy cudatoolkit=11.8 cudnn cutensor nccl
conda install -c anaconda h5py=3.6.0
```
3. From the project root directory, install the requirements with the following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage Prerequisites
1. Download the fastMRI knee and brain datasets from [here](https://fastmri.org/)
2. Set the directory of the multicoil fastMRI knee and brain datasets to where they are stored on your device
    - Change [variables.py](variables.py) to set the paths to the dataset and your prefered logging folder
3. Change the configurations for training in the config files located in **train/configs/** 


## Training
First, set the directory to the **train** folder
```
cd train
```

To train our model, modify the configuration file in [config_cinn_unet_multicoil](train/configs/config_cinn_unet_multicoil.py) and run the following command
```
python train_cnf.py --model_type MulticoilCNF 
```

To run the baseline model proposed in ["Conditional Invertible Neural Networks for Medical Imaging"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14520),
modify the configuration file in [config_cinn_unet_multicoil](train/configs/config_cinn_unet_multicoil.py) and run the following command
```
python train_cnf.py --model_type SinglecoilCNF 
```
Note: This can be run for the singlecoil case or for the multicoil case as in the ablation study.

All models will be saved in the logging folder specified in [variables.py](variables.py)

Some pretrained models can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fhhdBS6LnOYvqmpAPkAovdr2gxZombKu?usp=sharing). 
Note: These models were retrained with the new, cleaned code found in this repo. Metrics are similar to those reported in the paper, but
may vary slightly.
## Evaluation
To get the evaluation metrics like PSNR, SSIM, FID, and cFID, run the following command
```
python eval_cnf.py --load_ckpt_dir <path to the model checkpoint>

#Example
python eval_cnf.py --load_ckpt_dir /home/user/mri_cnf/MulticoilCNF/version_0/
```

To generate reconstructions using a trained model, run the following command
```
python generate_imgs.py --load_ckpt_dir <path to the model checkpoint>
```
You can specify which image to generate, how many posterior samples to generate, and more in the script



## Notes
- The first time using a dataset will invoke the preprocessing step required for compressing the coils. 
Subsequent runs will be much faster since this step can be skipped.
